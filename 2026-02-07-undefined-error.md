## What I was trying to do  
I wanted to make Spirit Stream display devotional text automatically.

## The problem  
I kept getting a “Not defined” error in my JavaScript.

## What I tried  
1. Looked at old working HTML files  
2. Compared variable names  
3. Commented out sections of code  
4. Ran the program step by step  

## What I learned  
- Small naming mismatches cause big failures  
- Reading old code is a form of debugging  
- I need to slow down and name things clearly  

## What I’ll try next  
- Rename variables consistently  
- Add console logs to trace the flow  
- Ask ChatGPT specific questions instead of general ones
